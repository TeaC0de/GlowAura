## 5. 🎨 Styling the GlowAura Experience
**Overview:**  
I customized the theme's color palette, typography, logo, and favicon to match the GlowAura aesthetic — soft tones, feminine accents, and minimalist layout choices.

## 6. 🎁 A Personal Touch (Exclusive Discount)
**Overview:**  
As part of a simulated supplier collaboration, I implemented a 15% “Exclusive Partner” discount and configured how it's shown across product and checkout pages.

## 7. ✨ What I Took Away 
- Navigating Shopify's backend interface  
- Managing content, inventory, and layout without writing raw code  
- Adapting pre-made tools to suit a custom concept  
- Thinking through user flow and digital brand identity
