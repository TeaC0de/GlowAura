# 🌸 GlowAura | Shopify Beauty/Cosmetics Store

This project was created as part of a Coursera guided project on building a Shopify store.  
While the original example featured a t-shirt shop, I chose to design my own concept — a beauty & cosmetics store called **GlowAura**, based in Vienna.  
This allowed me to explore the same technical foundations while expressing my own aesthetic and branding direction.

## 📍 Where It Stands
🛠️ In Progress — I plan to reactivate the Shopify store to finalize the design, gather screenshots and videos, and complete the visual documentation.

## 🌷 A Glimpse Into This Project   
GlowAura is a Vienna-based beauty concept store built using the Shopify platform.  
This project reflects both my interest in clean, accessible e-commerce design and my ability to learn and thoughtfully apply platform-specific tools.

## 💻 What I Worked On  
- Configured the Shopify storefront structure (homepage, collection pages, product pages)  
- Added and styled products with appropriate details, pricing, and categories  
- Implemented a 15% “Exclusive Partner” discount based on supplier collaboration  
- Customized store settings, branding elements, and theme appearance  
- Set up basic navigation, shipping zones, and store preferences  
- Learned to manage inventory, orders, and analytics through the Shopify admin

---

## 🎯 What I Wanted to Achieve  
- Build a fully functional, visually pleasant e-commerce store  
- Explore Shopify’s admin tools and customization options  
- Understand customer journey and backend logic of e-commerce

---

## 🌼 What I Plan on Doing  
Looking ahead, I plan to further refine GlowAura’s design by customizing the Shopify theme with CSS and JavaScript. This will allow me to:  
- Enhance the visual appeal and user experience with custom animations and responsive layouts  
- Tailor the storefront’s style to perfectly reflect the soft, feminine aesthetic of the brand  
- Introduce interactive elements that guide the customer journey in an intuitive way

## 📖 Behind the Scenes  
The store is currently offline as the Shopify trial has ended, but the process behind building **GlowAura** is still available to explore.
